# Indonesia Car Number Plate Detection

## Overview
This repository will show the method for detecting Indonesian plate car using Python OpenCV (non deep learning method)(`plate_detection_indonesia.py` file) . The method will use __contour detection concept__.

## Steps
1. The first step is image processing. It plays very important role for contour detection. In this code, for image processing, we will conduct : image processing from colored image to grayscale, then filtering, after that we conduct the adaptive Threshold. Adaptive threshold is applied because of its ability to handle different illuminaton intensity problem in an image.
